This application is built with [Clojure Tools CLI](https://clojure.org/guides/deps_and_cli), you need to install Java and Clojure before. 


### Run the application with Clojure CLI ###


Run the project directly, via `:main-opts`:

    $ clojure -M:run
    

You can also pass options :

    $ clojure -M:run -n 7    # Get the last 7 images
  
    $ clojure -M:run -h      # Display help
    

### Project tests ###

Run the project's tests from the task **test** in `build.clj`

    $ clojure -T:build test

### Continuous Integration ###

Run the project's CI pipeline and build an uberjar from the task **ci** in `build.clj`:

    $ clojure -T:build ci

Run that uberjar:

    $ java -jar target/my-app-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

If you remove `version` from `build.clj`, the uberjar will become `target/my-app-standalone.jar`.
